# Getting and Cleaning Data Project


The required data can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To use, extract the folder to desired location and place run_analysis.R into the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
Source the R script, and execute the run() function to obtain the cleaned data set

If you have downloaded the clean data set as a text file, use read.table() in R with header=TRUE
